    <h1 class="h2">What does advocacy mean?</h1>
    <p class="lead">Advocacy is when we speak up for our rights.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="row body">
    <div class="col">
      <p>Advocates work to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure everyone gets the same chances to work, eat, sleep, and live their lives.</li>
        <li>Make sure everyone feels safe.</li>
        <li>Make sure everyone is healthy.</li>
        <li>Make sure everyone is heard.</li>
        <li>Make sure that our land stays clean and safe.</li>
        <li>Make sure that everyone has the same information.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Anyone can be an advocate for themselves or for someone else.</p>

      <p>You just need to make sure you have the right information before you get started. Thatâ€™s where this toolkit, and other ways of educating yourself, comes in!</p>

      <p>Some people's jobs are to be an advocate for someone else.</p>

      <p>You probably know lots of people in your community who are advocates for your rights like: youth workers, community centre staff, teachers, principals, doctors and nurses, chiefs, and lawyers. </p>
